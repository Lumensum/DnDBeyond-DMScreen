Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy. When the castle was stormed only one coward off little faith filled its bags with greed, only to be punished in the night. You shall be wise to rid yourself of this all consuming disease and see material possessions are not worth your soul. You shall learn that knowledge is priceless. I see a lonely mill on a precipice guarded by the night your treasure lies there. Tread carefully.....</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;\">Giso (enchanter/ three of stars):&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> This card tells of a powerfull force for protection, family and a more peacefull past.

Broken but yet unbreakable, the spirit of vengeance lies within.&nbsp; And with few who know how to wield its power it now lies dorment. It lies in a place of treasure sealed away beyond a set of amber doors. Beware this place as your darkness lies within it, guarding. Don't let the past determine your future.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;\">Vayvakri ( the Ghost):&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> This card will shed light on one who will greatly aid in the battle against the darkness.

Temper his heart and you will win his sword in battle.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000; text-decoration: underline;\">the enemy ( the marionette ):&nbsp;</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> Your enemy is a creature of darkness whose powers are beyond mortality.
